            <h2>Beef and Noodles</h2>
                <p class="description">Description</p>
                    <p>A nice and simple play on the traditional beef stroganoff. Instead of roasting beef for hours, this recipe utilises roasted beef from the deli. Adding a twist at
                    the end to give a light and fresh taste
                </p>

            <h2>Nacho Pie</h2>
                <p class="description">Description</p>
                    <p>Truly a cheesy delicacy. Both pie and nachos made easier through substituting ground beef and mozzarella for sausage and cheddar cheese.
